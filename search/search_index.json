Setting up the prefix I want the bot to respond when I use the prefix - to do that, I can type !prefix set - . Carlbot offers up to 15 prefixes at once, so I could also add a second prefix by typing !prefix add . 2. Setting up all the channels !log channel <#channel> Sets the channel where carlbot will log things such as message deletions, name changes, role updates. More on that later. !set welcome <#channel> Decides where join/leave/ban messages go, more on that later. 3. Setting up reaction roles Reaction roles work best in their own channels, so carlbot offers a command to create a channel specifically for reaction roles with some permissions that most people will find useful. We can create this channel by typing !rr channel It's recommended that you use !rr make for this if you are new. 4. Setting up modlogs Since we're doing this from a clean slate, I will use !modlogs create to create a channel with the appropriate permissions. If we already had a channel where moderation actions were sent, we could have used !modlogs set <#channel> 5. Setting up starboard !starboard will create the starboard !star limit <count> will change the required number of stars for a post to show up in the starboard. 6. Configuring logs By default, the log will log everything every member does in every channel, this isn't always what we want. Let's say we don't care about message edits, the way we stop those from showing up in the log is by typing !log edit . The !log command takes an event as its argument and tries to figure out what you want toggled. Another thing we can do is ignore messages deleted in certain channels. Maybe we don't care about messages deleted in mod channels. !log ignore #illuminati is how we'd ignore events from the channel #illuminati. Read the full page for more info, it's very customizable. 7. Setting up a mute role By typing !muterole create we can create a role with the permission \"send messages\" denied in every channel. Please note that any future channels created will not be covered by the bot. Users can now mute with the !mute <@member> [time] [reason] command 8. Adding twitch streamers No point setting up a twitch channel if you don't have any streamers to track. I enjoy watching b0aty, so I'll add him by typing !twitch b0aty . Now any time b0aty comes online I will be notified. 9. Setting up join messages First we will set the message sent to the previously set channel with: !welcome Hello there {user}, glad to have you in the tutorial server We can also set a different message to be sent directly to the member upon joining by typing: !joindm Hello and welcome to the tutorial server, please read #rules and respect the other members This is far from everything carlbot has to offer, but at this point you will have set up most of the things that you can set up.","title":"Basic bot setup"},{"location":"basic-bot-setup/#basic-bot-setup","text":"Info This is much easier done on the website at https://piggy.gg This guide will cover everything you need to do to get started with everything carlbot offers.","title":"Basic bot setup"},{"location":"basic-bot-setup/#1-setting-up-the-prefix","text":"I want the bot to respond when I use the prefix - to do that, I can type !prefix set - .

Setting up join messages"},{"location":"faq/","text":"FAQ How do I create reaction roles? Most people are probably best off using !rr make simply because it guides you through the process and tries to tell you what went wrong if any. Other ways of doing it includes using !rr aio which results in the same result as !rr make but with just a single command, it uses some weird syntax if you are unfamiliar, so I would recommend sticking to !rr make until you are familiar with the bot. Here is a screenshot of me setting up unique reaction roles for my bot help server What's the drama channel? It's a premium feature that aims to streamline your server's moderation. Automod is nice, but it's not perfect, false positives happen. The drama channel was made for that exact reason. You need to: Set up the drama channel. Either on the dashboard or with the command !am drama <channel> Set the automod punishment to 'Post to drama channel (premium only)' on the dashboard Why does the bot complain about requiring more permissions? I've given it manage roles already! The way discord decides if you can add a role or not is based on two things: Does the member adding the role have 'manage roles' Is the member trying to add the role higher in the role hierarchy than the role they're trying to add? Just assign the bot a role that is higher than highest role it has to assign, the role being hoisted does not have to have any special permissions. How do I get a message ID? Discord settings -> Appearance -> Developer mode For reaction roles already set up you can also use !rr show How do I get the bot to announce new members joining? Use the dashboard! https://piggy.gg Just make sure to set a welcome channel in the top left box. You find the settings under 'welcome'. I don't want normal users creating tags, but I obviously can't disable tag, what do I do? !tag modonly will make it so that only mods can manage tags, while anyone can still use them I set up a highlight word but it's not working Yes it is. The bot tries to detect when you're reading the chat and not spam you with unnecessary pings. If you wish to see if a message would have triggered any of your words, use !hl match <sentence> Another bot has the same command and they both respond, what do I do? Depends on what you're after. If you need to use both, you're pretty much forced to change the prefix of either bot. If you're after just the non-carlbot command, you can disable it with !disable <command> . If you just want carlbot's command, I suppose you could create an alias using tags and {cmd:cmdname {args}} see the \"Advanced tag usage\" section for more information.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-create-reaction-roles","text":"Most people are probably best off using !rr make simply because it guides you through the process and tries to tell you what went wrong if any.

What is the help command for Piggy? Use /help and piggy will tell you a detailed list on how to use a command. I don't want to give Piggy the Administrator permission but I still want it to work to it's fullest potential. What can I do? If you insist on not giving Piggy the Administrator permission then Piggy will need the following permissions to function normally: Manage Server Manage Roles Manage Channels Read Messages Send Messages Add Reactions Mention @everyone and all roles to mention the piggyuser role for chest drops Embed Links Attach Files Additionally, you can use Discord's View as Role feature to see what channels piggy has access to by selecting the roles assigned to Piggy. Piggy won't be able to give XP for channels it cannot see. Why do I not see all the roles for auto-role assignment? Make sure the roles you want Piggy to assign are below the highest role the bot has. Also, make sure any of the below permissions are not present in the role that you want to assign: ADMINISTRATOR BAN MEMBERS KICK MEMBERS MANAGE CHANNELS MANAGE EMOJIS MANAGE SERVER MANAGE MESSAGES MANAGE NICKNAMES MANAGE ROLES MANAGE WEBHOOKS If a role has any of these permissions or they are above the highest role the bot has, it won't show in the dashboard.

Do the following: Check if piggy has all the permissions as per the following FAQ . Check if you changed prefix from the Dashboard . Check if you have set piggy to respond to only selected channels from the Dashboard . Try Clear All in the Piggy Commands will work only in channels selected by you field, and then re-add the channel you want piggy to only respond in, and then do Save. If none of it works, use the View Server as Role tool in your server from role list, and see if the Piggy role can send messages. Can you use Piggy purely as a levelling system for auto-role assignment? Yes, you can! Piggy is a levelling system first, along with an RPG game as an add on.

It would be foolish to underestimate the Musicians in combat, though. Gunslinger The vast plains inhabited by the Gunslinger Clan have seen some of the most dramatic Piggy Clan battles. The Gunslingers are, of course, expert markspiggies, and are often the first to strike in battle. Though they prefer a ranged fight, Gunslingers are dependable partners first and foremost.

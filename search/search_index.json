What is the help command for Piggy? Use /help and piggy will tell you a detailed list on how to use a command. I don't want to give Piggy the Administrator permission but I still want it to work to it's fullest potential. What can I do? If you insist on not giving Piggy the Administrator permission then Piggy will need the following permissions to function normally: Manage Server Manage Roles Manage Channels Read Messages Send Messages Add Reactions Mention @everyone and all roles to mention the piggyuser role for chest drops Embed Links Attach Files Additionally, you can use Discord's View as Role feature to see what channels piggy has access to by selecting the roles assigned to Piggy. Piggy won't be able to give XP for channels it cannot see. Why do I not see all the roles for auto-role assignment? Make sure the roles you want Piggy to assign are below the highest role the bot has. Also, make sure any of the below permissions are not present in the role that you want to assign: ADMINISTRATOR BAN MEMBERS KICK MEMBERS MANAGE CHANNELS MANAGE EMOJIS MANAGE SERVER MANAGE MESSAGES MANAGE NICKNAMES MANAGE ROLES MANAGE WEBHOOKS If a role has any of these permissions or they are above the highest role the bot has, it won't show in the dashboard. Why don't my commands work in DMs? If Piggy doesn't respond to you in DMs, then the issue is one of the following: You're using the wrong prefix. Check the correct prefix by mentioning Piggy. It is usually the prefix of your home server. You've DMs disabled from the server which Piggy is part of. Kindly use piggy in server as much as you can, as DM usage is being removed. How do I learn about Piggy Commands and it's working? We have videos on YouTube and you can also go through the below links: Piggy Commands Piggy Dashboard Buff List My Piggy Dashboard shows me in servers I have already left. We sometimes don't receive the event from discord for a member leaving a server, this is a common issue for bots. What you can do as a user is join and leave that server again. For admins we are working on a tool to manually fix this. There is no way for us to automatically fix this. How can we add piggy to our server? Visit Piggy.gg . Click on Invite to Server button to add the bot to your server. Piggy doesn't respond in my server, but it works in other servers. Do the following: Check if piggy has all the permissions as per the following FAQ . Check if you changed prefix from the Dashboard . Check if you have set piggy to respond to only selected channels from the Dashboard . Try Clear All in the Piggy Commands will work only in channels selected by you field, and then re-add the channel you want piggy to only respond in, and then do Save. If none of it works, use the View Server as Role tool in your server from role list, and see if the Piggy role can send messages. Can you use Piggy purely as a levelling system for auto-role assignment? Yes, you can! Piggy is a levelling system first, along with an RPG game as an add on. Anyone can level up by participating in the server conversations. How do I level up ? You can earn XP from trivia & chats and advance your level. Want to know your current level? Use /info .

With the war looking like a lost cause, the Clans send their young ones across the universe to Earth, where they might grow in peace and someday help retake their planet! Warriors The Warriors hail from the craggy mountains of the Piggies\u2019 home planet. They are resilient, defensive fighters, able to make the best out of difficult terrain and losing battles. A Warrior Piggy is at its most powerful when the enemy thinks it has the upper hand. Manga The Manga Clan are forest-dwellers, and exceptional treasure-hunters. But they are best known for their formidable attacking approach to battle \u2014 they fight often to the point of self-sacrifice. But their Clan has lost a few skirmishes with this strategy. Their tenacity and ferocity in battle make them one of the most powerful Piggy Clans. Strategist The Strategists\u2019 stronghold is a well-fortified port city; though all Clans prefer to keep to themselves, the Strategists understand the importance of trade. Their learned leaders pass on the keen ability to spy any enemy\u2019s weaknesses and thoroughly exploit them. Musician The Musician Clan\u2019s extraordinary cave system might be on the dark and dank side, but its incredible acoustic effects helped the first Piggy Musicians hone their art. It would be foolish to underestimate the Musicians in combat, though. Gunslinger The vast plains inhabited by the Gunslinger Clan have seen some of the most dramatic Piggy Clan battles. The Gunslingers are, of course, expert markspiggies, and are often the first to strike in battle. Though they prefer a ranged fight, Gunslingers are dependable partners first and foremost. Magician The Magician Clan hail from a city of their own, and practice arcane arts passed down from generation to generation. Don\u2019t be fooled by the wand and the hat \u2014 Magicians are not to be trifled with, for they are fighters and thinkers.","title":"Clans"},{"location":"Piggy-Infinity/clans/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Piggy-Infinity/clans/#warriors","text":"The Warriors hail from the craggy mountains of the Piggies\u2019 home planet.

How do they work? NPCs are added to list available battle members if there are too few battle members at your matching levels ( +-2 of levels from your level), they are randomly generated in real time, and try to be as close to other members in your bracket, their wealth depends a lot on your wealth. The chest drop pings all the people on my server, and they are now angry and have their pitchforks out to kill the admin, what do I do? Politely ask them to use, __ :-sub off __if they are few in numbers, or delete the role that piggy uses to mention them. By default the name of the role is piggyusers.

Now chest-daily commands shows you a timer in (HH) hours (MM) minutes after which you can claim your daily chest. Since daily chests are not unique to the server unlike surprise, but are limited to your piggy, the daily chest reminder is just a reminder to claim your chest, and not a chest drop itself. Why do I win less coins when I win and lose more coins when I lose? You win 5% of the opponents coin, if the opponent has 100 coins you get 5 of those when you win. Similarly if you lose 5% of your coins when you lose, if you have 100 coins, your opponent get 5 coins when you lose. If your opponent has less coins, you win less coins, if your opponent has more coins you win more coins. Why did lose that battle to an NPC or Another piggy with no buffs or less number of buffs than me? Their level was probably higher than you, levels make a huge change to your stats, and buffs can bring you closer to a piggy at higher level, but it is difficult to beat them. How do I sell buffs? You can sell buffs on Buff Mart or use the command :-buff-sell code .

You can report a bug in #\u300c\ud83d\ude35\u300dbot-support channel , and some one from @Piggy Team or from @Community Lords will help you out. How and who do I ask for support? You can message in #\u300c\ud83d\ude35\u300dbot-support channel , and someone from @Piggy Team or from @Community Lords will help you out. Hello, I don't know how to use a command. Use /help and piggy will tell you a detailed list on how to use a command. There are mistakes in trivia, or the trivia options are misleading, or too confusing, I don't like the order of the options. We use a third party service called OpenTriviaDatabase, we do not control the questions on the trivia, we send category to OpenTrivia, OpenTrivia sends us questions, it's a community curated platform on which we have no control at all, so we wouldn't be able to correct any mistakes in trivia. Hey! I feel piggy might be a virus, so I don't want to give it administrator permission, but I still want it to work to it's fullest potential. I assure you piggy is not a virus, but if you still insist on not giving it administrator permissions, piggy will need the following to function normally - Manage Server - Manage Roles - Manage channels - Read Messages - Send Messages - Add Reactions - Mention @everyone and all roles to mention the piggyuser role for chest drops. - Embed Links - Attach files Additionally, You can use discords new \"view as role\" feature to see what channels piggy has access too by selecting the roles assigned to piggy, piggy won't be able to give XP for channels it cannot see. Also, piggy is not a virus. What does /halt command do? :-halt on , this will halt all your piggies for a minimum of 3 days. :-halt off , this will start all your piggies if 3 days have passed since halted your piggies. :-halt force-off , this will forcefully start all your piggies by charging a penalty of 5% of your silver coins. Note: All your active trades will be canceled if your piggies are halted. You cannot halt your piggies if even one of them is blocked. Wait till all your piggies are unblocked if you intend to halt all your piggies. What does :-vote do ? :-vote shares the vote link for piggy on top.gg, where you can go and vote for piggy, when you vote for piggy, piggy gives you 100 coins if you have adopted piggy, you can verify the coins credit using :-logs command. What does :-logs do ? :-logs show you your coin transactions for last 10 days, the log is refreshed every 30 minutes, so if you have checked it once, please wait 30 minutes to check it again to get the updated logs. Why is there a 24 hour cooldown on trivia? We changed how trivia works in a recent update Link to the update announcement This change was warranted because of restrictions in DM performance. We did a survey for this, and people overwhelmingly voted for the this option. Link to the survey But soon after the update, we increased the attempts you have on trivia to 3 per day. Update announcement here How do I get piggy emoji? Use :-emoji command, it'll help you out. Why do I not see all the roles for auto-role assignment? Make sure the roles you want piggy to assign are below the highest role the bot has.

How to stop all notifications and de-adopt a piggy?

With the war looking like a lost cause, the Clans send their young ones across the universe to Earth, where they might grow in peace and someday help retake their planet! Warriors The Warriors hail from the craggy mountains of the Piggies\u2019 home planet. They are resilient, defensive fighters, able to make the best out of difficult terrain and losing battles. A Warrior Piggy is at its most powerful when the enemy thinks it has the upper hand. Manga The Manga Clan are forest-dwellers, and exceptional treasure-hunters. But they are best known for their formidable attacking approach to battle \u2014 they fight often to the point of self-sacrifice. But their Clan has lost a few skirmishes with this strategy. Their tenacity and ferocity in battle make them one of the most powerful Piggy Clans. Strategist The Strategists\u2019 stronghold is a well-fortified port city; though all Clans prefer to keep to themselves, the Strategists understand the importance of trade. Their learned leaders pass on the keen ability to spy any enemy\u2019s weaknesses and thoroughly exploit them. Musician The Musician Clan\u2019s extraordinary cave system might be on the dark and dank side, but its incredible acoustic effects helped the first Piggy Musicians hone their art. It would be foolish to underestimate the Musicians in combat, though. Gunslinger The vast plains inhabited by the Gunslinger Clan have seen some of the most dramatic Piggy Clan battles. The Gunslingers are, of course, expert markspiggies, and are often the first to strike in battle. Though they prefer a ranged fight, Gunslingers are dependable partners first and foremost. Magician The Magician Clan hail from a city of their own, and practice arcane arts passed down from generation to generation. Don\u2019t be fooled by the wand and the hat \u2014 Magicians are not to be trifled with, for they are fighters and thinkers.","title":"Clans"},{"location":"Piggy-Infinity/clans/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Piggy-Infinity/clans/#warriors","text":"The Warriors hail from the craggy mountains of the Piggies\u2019 home planet.

Now chest-daily commands shows you a timer in (HH) hours (MM) minutes after which you can claim your daily chest.

We use a third party service called OpenTriviaDatabase, we do not control the questions on the trivia, we send category to OpenTrivia, OpenTrivia sends us questions, it's a community curated platform on which we have no control at all, so we wouldn't be able to correct any mistakes in trivia.

This change was warranted because of restrictions in DM performance. We did a survey for this, and people overwhelmingly voted for the this option.
[Link to the survey](https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/747419848216150096/780323499155783701)

Make sure the roles you want piggy to assign are below the highest role the bot has. Also, make sure any of the below are permissions are not present in the role that you want to assign

### Why don't my commands work in DMs ?
If Piggy doesn't respond to you in DMs, then the issue is one of the following:
- You're using the wrong prefix. check the correct prefix by mentioning Piggy. It is usually the prefix of your home server.
- You've DMs disabled from a server which is piggy is part of, and Piggy cannot send you messages (I am not sure how discord decides the server relationship between users, but it is a common reason often)
- All commands will be moved to server in the future, and almost all existing commands work in server too, kindly use piggy in server as much as you can, as DM usage is being removed.

### How do I become a Community Lord?
Reach at least level 30 in this server, be helpful to other users, and then if admins feel that you're friendly enough, they'll make you a community lord! One you become a lord, you'll have the title Lord in your nick name.

### What are the perks of being Community Lord?
You get to set a custom nickname, and you also get access to a secret channel, a mentionable role, that is permanently displayed on the member list.

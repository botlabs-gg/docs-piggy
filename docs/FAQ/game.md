### What are NPCs? How do they work?
NPCs are added to list available battle members if there are too few battle members at your matching levels ( +-2 of levels from your level), they are randomly generated in real time, and try to be as close to other members in your bracket, their wealth depends a lot on your wealth.

Politely ask them to use, __`:-sub off `__if they are few in numbers, or delete the role that piggy uses to mention them. By default the name of the role is piggyusers.

### How do I redeem a daily chest?
You type __`:-chest-redeem daily`__ in any one server and the chest gives you coins. Remember, you can only claim 1 total daily chest in 24 hours, no matter how many servers you're part of. If you claimed a daily chest at 7 AM today, you'll be able to claim it again after 7 AM tomorrow, even if the chest drops at 5AM. Now chest-daily commands shows you a timer in (HH) hours (MM) minutes after which you can claim your daily chest. Since daily chests are not unique to the server unlike surprise, but are limited to your piggy, the daily chest reminder is just a reminder to claim your chest, and not a chest drop itself.

### Why do I win less coins when I win and lose more coins when I lose?
You win 5% of the opponents coin, if the opponent has 100 coins you get 5 of those when you win. Similarly if you lose 5% of your coins when you lose, if you have 100 coins, your opponent get 5 coins when you lose. If your opponent has less coins, you win less coins, if your opponent has more coins you win more coins.

Their level was probably higher than you, levels make a huge change to your stats, and buffs can bring you closer to a piggy at higher level, but it is difficult to beat them.

### How do I report a bug?
You can report a bug in [#„Äåüòµ„Äçbot-support channel](https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/744906533741002849), and some one from __`@Piggy Team`__ or from __`@Community Lords`__ will help you out.

### How and who do I ask for support?
You can message in [#„Äåüòµ„Äçbot-support channel](https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/744906533741002849), and someone from __`@Piggy Team`__ or from __`@Community Lords`__ will help you out.

### Hello, I don't know how to use a command.
Use __`/help`__ and piggy will tell you a detailed list on how to use a command.

### There are mistakes in trivia, or the trivia options are misleading, or too confusing, I don't like the order of the options.
We use a third party service called OpenTriviaDatabase, we do not control the questions on the trivia, we send category to OpenTrivia, OpenTrivia sends us questions, it's a community curated platform on which we have no control at all, so we wouldn't be able to correct any mistakes in trivia.

### Hey! I feel piggy might be a virus, so I don't want to give it administrator permission, but I still want it to work to it's fullest potential.
I assure you piggy is not a virus, but if you still insist on not giving it administrator permissions, piggy will need the following to function normally
- Manage Server
- Manage Roles
- Manage channels
- Read Messages
- Send Messages
- Add Reactions
- Mention @everyone and all roles to mention the piggyuser role for chest drops.
- Embed Links
- Attach files
Additionally, You can use discords new "view as role" feature to see what channels piggy has access too by selecting the roles assigned to piggy, piggy won't be able to give XP for channels it cannot see. Also, piggy is not a virus.

### What does /halt command do?
__`:-halt on`__, this will halt all your piggies for a minimum of 3 days.
__`:-halt off`__, this will start all your piggies if 3 days have passed since halted your piggies.
__`:-halt force-off`__, this will forcefully start all your piggies by charging a penalty of 5% of your silver coins.
Note:
All your active trades will be canceled if your piggies are halted.
You cannot halt your piggies if even one of them is blocked. Wait till all your piggies are unblocked if you intend to halt all your piggies.

### What does :-vote do ?
__`:-vote`__ shares the vote link for piggy on top.gg, where you can go and vote for piggy, when you vote for piggy, piggy gives you 100 coins if you have adopted piggy, you can verify the coins credit using __`:-logs`__ command.

### What does :-logs do ?
__`:-logs`__ show you your coin transactions for last 10 days, the log is refreshed every 30 minutes, so if you have checked it once, please wait 30 minutes to check it again to get the updated logs.

### Why is there a 24 hour cooldown on trivia?
We changed how trivia works in a recent update
[Link to the update announcement](https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/744907108599726091/783297706504355841)
This change was warranted because of restrictions in DM performance. We did a survey for this, and people overwhelmingly voted for the this option.

But soon after the update, we increased the attempts you have on trivia to 3 per day.

### How do I get piggy emoji?
Use __`:-emoji`__ command, it'll help you out.

### Why do I not see all the roles for auto-role assignment?
Make sure the roles you want piggy to assign are below the highest role the bot has. Also, make sure any of the below are permissions are not present in the role that you want to assign
ADMINISTRATOR,
BAN MEMBERS,
KICK MEMBERS,
MANAGE CHANNELS,
MANAGE EMOJIS,
MANAGE SERVER,
MANAGE MESSAGES,
MANAGE NICKNAMES,
MANAGE ROLES,
MANAGE WEBHOOKS
If a role has any of these permissions, or they are above the highest role the bot has, it won't show in the dashboard.

### How to stop all notifications and de-adopt a piggy?
You can use the __`/abandon`__ command to abandon a Piggy, and you can do __`/adopt`__ to readopt a piggy, however, users will have to do __`:-sub off`__ to remove the role from each server.

### Why don't my commands work in DMs ?
If Piggy doesn't respond to you in DMs, then the issue is one of the following:
- You're using the wrong prefix. check the correct prefix by mentioning Piggy. It is usually the prefix of your home server.
- You've DMs disabled from a server which is piggy is part of, and Piggy cannot send you messages (I am not sure how discord decides the server relationship between users, but it is a common reason often)
- All commands will be moved to server in the future, and almost all existing commands work in server too, kindly use piggy in server as much as you can, as DM usage is being removed.

### How do I learn about Piggy Commands and it's working?
We have videos in [#„Äå‚ñ∂„Äçpiggy-verse](https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/755673916059680849%22) and you can also go through the below links.

We sometimes don't receive the event from discord for a member leaving a server, this is a common issue for bots, what. you can do as a user is join and leave that server again. For admins we are working on a tool to manually fix this. There is no way for us to automatically fix this.

### Piggy doesn't respond in my server, but it works in other server
Do the following:
- Check if piggy has all the permissions as per the following [FAQ](https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/755526783121752105/760065445059100674)
- Check if you changed prefix from [Dashboard](https://piggy.gg/dashboard)
- Check if you have set piggy to respond to only selected channels from the [Dashboard](https://piggy.gg/dashboard)
- Try __Clear All__ in the __Piggy Commands will work only in channels selected by you__ field, and then re-add the channel you want piggy to only respond in, and then do Save
- If none of it works, use the View Server as Role tool in your server from role list, and see if the __Piggy__ role can send messages.

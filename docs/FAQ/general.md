# General

## How to use **xyz** command? What is the help command for Piggy?
Use <code><b>/help</code></b> and piggy will tell you a detailed list on how to use a command.

## I don't want to give Piggy the Administrator permission but I still want it to work to it's fullest potential. What can I do?
If you insist on not giving Piggy the Administrator permission then Piggy will need the following permissions to function normally:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Manage Server
<li>Manage Roles
<li>Manage Channels
<li>Read Messages
<li>Send Messages
<li>Add Reactions
<li>Mention @everyone and all roles to mention the piggyuser role for chest drops
<li>Embed Links
<li>Attach Files
</ul>
Additionally, you can use Discord's <b>View as Role</b> feature to see what channels piggy has access to by selecting the roles assigned to Piggy. Piggy won't be able to give XP for channels it cannot see. 

## Why do I not see all the roles for auto-role assignment?
Make sure the roles you want Piggy to assign are below the highest role the bot has. Also, make sure any of the below permissions are not present in the role that you want to assign:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>ADMINISTRATOR
<li>BAN MEMBERS
<li>KICK MEMBERS
<li>MANAGE CHANNELS
<li>MANAGE EMOJIS
<li>MANAGE SERVER
<li>MANAGE MESSAGES
<li>MANAGE NICKNAMES
<li>MANAGE ROLES
<li>MANAGE WEBHOOKS
</ul>
If a role has any of these permissions or they are above the highest role the bot has, it won't show in the dashboard.

## How do I learn about Piggy Commands and it's working?
We have videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PiggyBot/featured">YouTube</a> and you can also go through the below links:<br>

</ul>

## My Piggy Dashboard shows me in servers I have already left.
We sometimes don't receive the event from discord for a member leaving a server, this is a common issue for bots. What you can do as a user is join and leave that server again. For admins we are working on a tool to manually fix this. There is no way for us to automatically fix this.

## How can we add piggy to our server?
Visit <a href="https://piggy.gg">Piggy.gg</a>.<br>
Click on Invite to Server button to add the bot to your server.

## Piggy doesn't respond in my server, but it works in other servers.
Do the following:
<ul>
<li>Check if piggy has all the permissions as per the following <a href=https://discord.com/channels/744906533657378948/755526783121752105/760065445059100674>FAQ</a>.
<li>Check if you changed prefix from the <a href="https://piggy.gg/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.
<li>Check if you have set piggy to respond to only selected channels from the <a href="https://piggy.gg/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.
<li>Try <b>Clear All</b> in the Piggy Commands will work only in channels selected by you field, and then re-add the channel you want piggy to only respond in, and then do Save.
<li>If none of it works, use the View Server as Role tool in your server from role list, and see if the Piggy role can send messages.
</ul>

## Can you use Piggy purely as a levelling system for auto-role assignment?
Yes, you can! Piggy is a levelling system first, along with an RPG game as an add on. Anyone can level up by participating in the server conversations.

## How do I level up ?
You can earn XP from trivia & chats and advance your level.<br>
Want to know your current level? Use <code><b>/info</code></b>.<br>
Remember that your Levels are different in each server and leaving a server means your level will be reset to 1.<br>
